TODO!
=====

* update and add instructor docs
* add a team resolution server to direct input to get_attacker_input and resolve the port number issue
* figure out how a compiler flag should be passed to the calc installer script, perhaps this is something that should be pre-configured, or maybe flags arguments are passed seperately at the end
* make the scoring system generic to allow for other types of exercises besides Language Security
