fuzzy_challenge
===============

A fuzzing challenge for the Dynamic Wargaming Framework - EDURange

In this scenario the goal is for a defending team of players to create a calculator that doesn't crash when tested with an attacking team's fuzzing program, and correctly implement the given calculator specification. There is also a level 0 (where the fuzzing is a static set of tests) and a 'level 1i' (where the goal of two teams is to produce a grammar for a given language and prove that each team's grammars accept the same language).
